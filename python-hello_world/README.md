# Python-hello_world

This project focuses on two pivotal aspects of software development: debugging and automation. By engaging with these tasks, you’ll learn how to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT to not only identify and resolve errors more efficiently but also to automate repetitive coding tasks, thereby increasing your productivity and improving the quality of your code.

## Functionalities :



## Objectives :

- `Debugging`: Understand the practical use of AI in identifying and solving coding errors. You will use ChatGPT to diagnose and correct bugs in provided code samples across multiple programming languages. This will enhance your problem-solving skills and understanding of common programming pitfalls in a diverse set of coding environments.
- `Automation`: Learn how to automate mundane and repetitive coding tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT. This involves generating boilerplate code, documentation, and even basic unit tests, freeing up time to focus on more complex and creative aspects of software development.

## Outcomes :

- `Enhanced Debugging Skills`: Gain confidence in troubleshooting and refining code, with an ability to articulate problems clearly and implement AI-driven solutions effectively.
- `Automation Proficiency`: Develop skills to leverage AI for automating coding tasks, leading to more structured and error-free code.

## Files :

- `lists.h`: Header file containing prototypes and include guards.
- `factorial.py`: Fix the code, it should print the factorial of the argument.
- `print_arguments.py`: Fix the code, it should print only the arguments without the python file name.
- `change_background.html`: Fix the code, it should change the background color when you click on the button.
- `mines.py`: Fix the code, implement a mechanism to detect when all non-mine cells have been revealed, thus winning the game.
- `factorial_recursive.py`: Add the comments to this code. You should have 3 sections: function description, parameters and returns.
- `checkbook.py`: Fix the code, to prevent the program from crashing due to invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values), add error handling mechanisms.
- `tic.py`: Players alternate placing “X” or “O” on a 3x3 board, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
- `README.md`: Description of the project.
